### Project Title
Explore the BikeShare Data

### Description
This project aims to uncover bike share usage patterns in the first half of 2017, based on the data from a bike share system provider <a href="https://www.motivateco.com/">Motivate</a>.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)


The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

You can find the data files as follows:
